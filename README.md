# Spring-Transactions

[Good Summary](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8490852/spring-transactional-isolation-propagation)

[Details of Spring Tx](https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/spring-transaction-management-transactional-in-depth)

[employee organization example](https://www.javainuse.com/spring/boot-transaction)

## Admission Service

1. Register a Student
2. Register Student in Department
3. Register Student in Hostel (Optional and based on Gender)
4. Register Student in a Society (Optional)

In the above Example, the transaction is propagated in the same order as mentioned above.

# Propagation

[Tx Pitfalls](https://medium.com/@safa_ertekin/common-transaction-propagation-pitfalls-in-spring-framework-2378ee7d6521)

[Tx Propagation](https://www.javainuse.com/spring/boot-transaction-propagation)

Let's consider a transaction : Student Service -> Department Service

REQUIRED (Default Transaction Propagation) - Always executes in a transaction. If there is any existing transaction it uses it. 
If none exists then only a new one is created

If Student Service does not have a Transactional Annotation, and Department Service has REQUIRED, then a new Tx will be created.


MANDATORY - Always executes in a transaction. If there is any existing transaction it is used. If there is no existing transaction it will throw an exception.

If Student Service does not have a Transactional Annotation, and Department Service has 
```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.MANDATORY)
```
then the exception 
```java
nested exception is org.springframework.transaction.IllegalTransactionStateException: No existing transaction found for transaction marked with propagation 'mandatory'] with root cause
org.springframework.transaction.IllegalTransactionStateException: No existing transaction found for transaction marked with propagation 'mandatory' 
```

NEVER - Always executes with out any transaction. It throws an exception if there is an existing transaction
If Student Service has a Transactional Annotation, and Department Service has 
```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NEVER)
```
Then there should be an exception. In the Replicated Example, appears that the default save method of JPA creates an internal Tx which is why it works.

REQUIRES_NEW : Always executes in a new transaction. If there is any existing transaction it gets suspended.
Irrespective of the Calling method, the new Transaction is created. If the calling method has a Tx, then its suspended and gets resumed after the called Tx is completed.

# Isolation - For Concurrent Transactions

The default transaction isolation taken is that of the underlying database.

* The default isolation level is **REPEATABLE READ**  for MySQL database.
* H2 - The default is **read committed**. H2 supports only three isolation levels; read uncommitted, read committed and serializable 
which can only be set at the connection level (not per transaction).
* Oracle only supports **read committed** (default) and serializable.

## Isolation Problems
[Isolation Eg](https://www.javainuse.com/spring/boot-transaction-isolation)
[Isolation Article](https://medium.com/@elliotchance/sql-transaction-isolation-levels-explained-50d1a2f90d8f)

* **Dirty Reads** : When current transaction reads a row written by another uncommitted transaction that is in progress.
* **Non-repeatable Reads** : It occurs when current transaction reads the same data within one Transaction, but gets two 
different values, because another transaction has been committed during the life of the current transaction.
* **Phantom Reads** : (special case of non repeatable read) A phantom read happens when current transaction re-executes 
a query with search condition, receiving different results, because there has been a recently-committed transaction 
between two reads of the current Transaction.

## SQL Solution
The SQL Standard defines four isolation levels 

* **Read uncommitted** permits dirty reads, non repeatable reads and phantom reads.
* **Read committed** permits non repeatable reads and phantom reads.
* **Repeatable read** permits only phantom reads.
* **Serializable** does not permit any read errors but is slower as it is absolute Isolation.


# Rollback

Programatically handle roll back in the event of a checked exception.

In case of a checked exceptions the previously executed transactions do not get rolled back automatically even if transaction annotation is used. 
This is achieved via the RollbackFor annotation.

A checked exception is a type of exception that must be either caught or declared in the method in which it is thrown

Example: With Admission Service, if an invalid Hostel Exception is thrown, then the Tx prior to Hostel Tx (Student and Department) would be committed successfully, which is not desirable.
The requirement here is to have Student, Department, Hostel and Society Txs to be completed in its entirety or not committed at all.


```java
@Transactional(rollbackFor = InvalidHostelException.class)
   public void addStudent(Student student, Department department, Hostel hostel, Society society)
                        throws InvalidHostelException {
}
